A huge amount of my time now is spent reading, for both school and leisure. In recent years, my reading diet have been dominated by technical content. I prefer physical books. This section is a place for books I {have read, hope to own, read fully, read partially}.

With a life expectancy of 81 years + An average of 2 books per year, I can choose only about 120 books out there to read and ["accept that I'll sign off for eternity without knowing what goes on in all the rest"](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html).

### Fiction

### Computing 

Most of these are textbooks, references, or just plain classical texts in the field. The status syntax is inspired by the symbolic notation used to describe the permissions of a file in a Unix system. 

*`rop`, r = read, o = owned, p = read partially / going through the book*\
*E.g. `-o-` means I own a physical copy but have not read it at all*
