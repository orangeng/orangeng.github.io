title: Read 
---

A huge amount of my time now is spent reading, for both school and leisure. In recent years, my reading diet have been dominated by technical content. I prefer physical books. This section is a place for books I {have read, hope to own, read fully, read partially}.

The status syntax is inspired by the symbolic notation used to describe the permissions of a file in a Unix system. 

*`rop`, r = read, o = owned, p = read partially / going through the book*\
*E.g. `-o-` means I own a physical copy but have not read it at all*


All-time favourite: The Chronicles of Narnia series


### Computing 

Most of these are textbooks, references, or just plain classical texts in the field.
