I'm a computer-science student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I like operating systems, open-source software, world history, old music and well-written Wikipedia pages.

### **Projects**

*rex-iptables*\
rex is a framework for writing safe Linux kernel extensions, addressing some problems faced by eBPF. I am writing an implementation of iptables using the rex framework. This is part of ongoing research with Prof Tianyin Xu and PhD student Jinghao Jia.

[*par-file-server*](https://github.com/orangeng/par-file-server)\
A multi-threaded file transfer CLI tool written in Rust

[*cbindgen*](https://github.com/mozilla/cbindgen/pull/905)\
cbindgen is a tool written by Mozilla engineers that generates C/C++/Python bindings for libraries written in Rust. I extended the project so that the parser can resolve fully-qualified [associated types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#specifying-placeholder-types-in-trait-definitions-with-associated-types).

minimal distributed system\
A minimal distributed system for deploying map-reduce like batch jobs written in Rust. Has distributed grep, membership lists tracking, failure detection and a simple distributed file storage.

### **Linux**
I started trying Linux after working in a Physics lab entirely powered by Linux kernels. I now run Arch and Gentoo, though I partially regret both choices. I am part of the [Linux Users Group at UIUC](https://lug.acm.illinois.edu/). We meet weekly, come join us!
