The papers that I have {read, want to read}. The original idea was to write my thoughts for the papers I have read. However, \[ d(no of papers to read)/dt \>\> d(no of papers read)/dt \]. Hence, this list is more of an index of things that I hope to get to in this lifetime. 

Not a list of the most cutting-edge technologies, since system topics are usually old and many papers here are classics in the topics they discuss.
